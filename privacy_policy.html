	<h1>levibostian.com Privacy Policy</h1>
	This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

When using any of the terms "I", "my", "we", "us", or "our" they all refer to Levi Bostian. The terms "you", "your", "user" all refer to you, the reader and receiver of this document.

	<h3><b>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</b></h3>

	<h3><b>When do we collect information?</b></h3>

	<h3><b>How do we protect visitor information?</b></h3>

	Our website is hosted by GitHub on the GitHub Pages service where they provide security for the users of our page. GitHub’s security policy can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/
	We do not use an SSL certificate on our website. We choose not to implement one at this time because there is no PII transferred between our web server and your web client device that would require the security of a SSL certificate. Our third parties who collect PII through our website do implement a SSL certificate to protect your browsing through our website.

	<h3><b>Do we use 'cookies'?</b></h3>

	Not at this time. I would request cookies if I decided to use Google Analytics for example in the future but as of right now, I choose not to use these sorts of services. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

	<h3><b>Third Party Disclosure</b></h3>

	We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

	<h3><b>Third party links</b></h3>

	We do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.

	<h3><b>MailChimp</b></h3>

	We use a tool called MailChimp, http://mailchimp.com, to send our email mailing list newsletters. MailChimp contains all of the email addresses that we have collected from individuals as well as provides a service that allows us to create HTML emails to send to all of the individuals. We use this service that MailChimp provides to send out emails to the individuals that have either opted-in to our email maililing lists via our website, social media, emails or some other digital method or by some other form of permission from the invidual to join the mailing list by us manually adding them to the mailing list. We send periodic emails through the MailChimp service to alert the signed up individuals about new blog posts, updates and/or releases or some other announcement that the I feel is worth telling my users about. I ask our users for their email address that is sent to MailChimp to be added to our mailing lists but MailChimp may collect more data about our users if they wish according to their privacy policy. By using our email mailing list signup functionality, you accept this privacy policy as well as MailChimp's privacy policy found here: http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/

	<h3><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></h3>
	We do not collect information from children under 13. Though, if children decide to visit my website and/or sign up for my newsletter I am not responsible for this as I cannot prevent children from doing this. 

	<h3><b>We adhere to the following COPPA tenants:</b></h3>
	Parents can review, delete, manage or refuse with whom their child's information is shared through contacting me directly.

	<h3><b>Fair Information Practices</b></h3>

	<h3><b>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</b></h3>
	We will notify the users via in site notification within 1 business day

	We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
