# Casper

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Casper 1.5 is (actually this time) the last release of Casper's original design, created to be compatible **with Ghost 2.0** and above. If you are running an earlier version of Ghost, you will need [Casper 1.4](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases/tag/1.4.0). We recommend switching to the [latest release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) of Casper, with an updated design, as soon as possible.
