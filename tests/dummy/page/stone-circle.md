[Stone Circle is a small, independent software consulting company that leverages the power of Ember to build products](https://stonecircle.io). If you are interested in what we do you can reach out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stonecircle_co) or contact us through [our website](https://stonecircle.io).

This system is entirely open source so if you want to see how it works or if you would like to contribute please [check out the git repository](https://github.com/stonecircle/ember-ghost)

We decided to build Ember Ghost as a result of the work the we did on the new [Ember Guides App](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app) and if you want to read more about how we did it you can check out our [The Right Way™️ to build the Ember Guides](https://blog.stonecircle.io/tag/guides-app) blog series
