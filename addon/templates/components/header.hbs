Wow what the hell is going on in here even?

Ok so, several templates use this big header with a giant BG image. Nice idea, but big images
have a heavy impact on performance, so it's a good idea to make them responsive. Because we
can only get the image dynamically using Handlebars, and we can only set the image to properly
be a background image using CSS, we end up with a handful of inline styles.

If the template in question has a background image, then we render responsive image styles
for it, and apply those styles to the <header> tag. Else, we just output a <header> tag
with a `no-image` class so we can style it accordingly.

{{#if background}}

<style type="text/css">
.responsive-header-img {
    background-image: url({{background}});
}
</style>
{{/if}}
{{yield}}
